# Poppin
Our independent study app prototype for safe campus engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Final release: https://github.com/Poppin-Tech-LLC/PoppinREPO

Some of the most prominent features include:

  - Map View: displays a map interface of the university campus with colored popsicles showcasing different events happening around.
  
  - Menu View: sliding hamburger menu containing map filters and links to the user's profile and settings.
  
  - Create Event View: form to be filled out by a user to create a map popsicle to showcase an event.  

  - Profile View: displays events created by a user and his/her settings.
  
  - Authentication: users can create and delete an account, as well as, log in, log out and recover their forgotten password.
  
  - Cloud Database: event data and user credentials are stored in Firebase, and with the help of Cloud Functions, the map is updated automatically to reflect the expiration of old events and the creation of new ones.
